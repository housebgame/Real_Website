## 🚀 How to Use the Enhanced Website

### **Option 1: Replace Current Homepage**
```bash
# Backup current file (already done)

mv index-enhanced.html index.html
```

### **Option 2: Preview Side-by-Side**
Open `index-enhanced.html` in your browser to preview, keep `index.html` as is.

---

## 📊 What You Need to Add

### **1. Update Images**
Replace placeholder images in `scripts/projects-data.js`:

```javascript
// For Unity Tools
tools: [
    {
        image: 'images/your-tool-screenshot.png',  // ← Add your tool images
        // ...
    }
]

// For Assets
assets: [
    {
        image: 'images/your-asset-preview.png',  // ← Add your asset images
        // ...
    }
]
```

### **2. Add More Projects**
Edit `scripts/projects-data.js` to add more tools/assets:

```javascript
tools: [
    {
        id: 'my-unity-tool',
        title: 'My Unity Tool',
        subtitle: 'Editor Extension',
        description: 'What it does...',
        image: 'images/tool.png',
        links: {
            github: 'https://...',
            playPage: 'pages/tools/my-tool.html'
        }
    },
    // Add more...
]
```

### **3. Create Individual Project Pages**
When user clicks on a game/tool, they'll go to detail pages:
- `pages/games/letro.html`
- `pages/games/simple-words-pro.html`
- etc.

I can create these next if you want!
